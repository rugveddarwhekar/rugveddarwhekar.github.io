# About Me 


I am an MS graduate (May 2020) with a Computer Science major from California State University, Northridge. During the course of my academic career, I also managed to gain experience in fields such as Web Development, Java Programming, and UI/UX Design. I have designed and developed various projects relating to Machine Learning, Android, Web, and Python-based technologies. I would describe myself as a very determined and highly motivated person. I do take my job seriously, but I’m able to see things in perspective and believe I’m quite easy-going to work with. I’m very good at finding solutions to problems. Above all, I would say I’m a positive and enthusiastic person – and I relish a challenge.
